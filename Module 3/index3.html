                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>The third module was cac, in which we were told about the laser machine It is necessary to take precautions in how it is used. How do you upload the image in it? How does the laser in the machine move? How can its width be set? These changes We have been told all the information about this laser cutting machine. At last   Finally we formed a group of four members to do a group assignment. It was a final project.In it we made a design on fusion 360 and laser cut it on cardboard</p>
                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>Computer-aided cutting (CAC) is a technology that utilizes computer-controlled machines to precisely cut various materials such as wood, metal, plastic, and fabric.Computer-aided cutting, also known as computer numerical control (CNC) cutting, refers to the process of using computer-controlled machines to precisely cut various materials. These machines follow programmed instructions to execute precise cutting tasks. Some common types of computer-aided cutting technologies include laser cutting, waterjet cutting, and plasma cutting.</p>

                <p>Laser cutting machines work by using a high-powered laser beam to precisely cut through materials.</p>

                <h4>1.CAD (Computer-Aided Design) Software:</h4>
                <ul><p> <li>CAD software is used to create the initial designs or drawings of the parts or products to be cut. Users can create precise 2D or 3D models of the desired objects, including specific dimensions, shapes, and details.</li>
                 <li>Examples: AutoCAD, SolidWorks, Autodesk Inventor, Fusion 360. </li>
   </p> </ul>



   <h4>2.Laser Cutting Control Software:</h4>
   <ul><p> <li>Laser cutting machines often come with their own proprietary control software, which allows users to interface with the machine, upload cutting files, adjust cutting parameters, and monitor the cutting process.</li>
    <li>This software typically provides a user-friendly interface with options to import designs from CAD/CAM software, set cutting parameters such as speed and power, simulate cutting paths, and initiate cutting operations. </li>
<li>Examples: LightBurn, RDWorks, LaserCut, RetinaEngrave, LaserWORKS.</li>
</p> </ul>


<h4>3.Design and Graphics Software:</h4>
<ul><p> <li>In addition to CAD software, various design and graphics software are used to create or manipulate graphics, logos, text, and other visual elements that may be incorporated into laser-cut products.</li>
 <li>These software tools often provide features for creating vector graphics, editing images, and adding text, which can then be imported into CAD/CAM software for laser cutting.</li>
<li>Examples: Adobe Illustrator, CorelDRAW, Inkscape, Affinity Designer.</li>
</p> </ul>


<p>These software tools work together to facilitate the design, programming, and execution of laser cutting operations, enabling users to create intricate and precise cuts across a wide range of materials and applications.</p>

<h1 class="gallery">Press Fit</h1>
<p>Press fit is a technique used in various manufacturing processes, including laser cutting, where parts are designed to fit together tightly without the need for adhesives or fasteners. In laser cutting, press fit involves creating parts with precise tolerances so they can be assembled by simply pushing them together, relying on the friction between the surfaces to hold them securely. This method is popular in the fabrication of prototypes, assemblies, and even finished products made from materials suitable for laser cutting, such as acrylic, wood, and some metals.</p>
