        <h2>Introduction to 3D Printing</h2>
        <ul><li>3D printing, also known as additive manufacturing, is a process of creating three-dimensional objects from a digital file</li>
        <li>It works by adding material layer by layer until the object is formed, unlike traditional subtractive manufacturing methods where material is removed from a block.</li></ul>

        <h2>Types of 3D Printing Technologies:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM): Most common type, where thermoplastic filaments are melted and extruded through a nozzle.</li>
            <li>Stereolithography (SLA): Uses a UV laser to cure liquid resin into solid layers.</li>
            <li>Selective Laser Sintering (SLS): Utilizes a laser to sinter powdered material, such as metal or nylon, into solid layers.</li>
       <li>Digital Light Processing (DLP): Similar to SLA but uses a digital light projector to cure resin.</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Applications:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Prototyping: One of the earliest and still most prevalent uses of 3D printing is rapid prototyping, enabling designers to quickly iterate on designs.</li>
        <li>Manufacturing: 3D printing is increasingly used in small-scale manufacturing for customized or low-volume production.</li>
        <li>Medicine and Healthcare: From prosthetics to surgical tools to personalized implants, 3D printing is revolutionizing healthcare. </li>
   <li>Education: It's used in schools and universities to teach design, engineering, and manufacturing concepts</li>
    </ul>
